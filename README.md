**Abstract**

This project evaluates the performance of various digital advertising campaigns to identify the most effective strategies for a digital marketing department. By examining key metrics like revenue, cost, and return on investment (ROI), we uncover insights into which campaigns yield the highest returns. This analysis provides actionable recommendations to optimize advertising spending and improve overall campaign effectiveness. The findings will help the digital marketing team make data-driven decisions to maximize their marketing impact and budget efficiency.

**Introduction**

In the current digital marketing landscape, understanding campaign effectiveness is crucial for strategic budget allocation and maximizing return on investment (ROI). The digital marketing department faces the challenge of determining which of their advertising campaigns deliver the best outcomes. With multiple campaigns running across different channels and formats, it is often difficult to assess which ads drive the most revenue and engagement. Ineffective budgeting can lead to missed opportunities or over-investment in underperforming campaigns. This project aims to address these challenges by analyzing a dataset of digital advertising campaigns. The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

Identify campaigns with the highest and lowest revenue.
Determine if there is a correlation between advertising costs and revenue.
Identify campaigns with the highest ROI. By addressing these questions, we aim to provide insights that will allow the digital marketing department to make data-driven decisions to optimize future campaigns and budget allocations.


**Methodology**

Data Sources The dataset used in this analysis contains detailed information on multiple digital advertising campaigns, including metrics that track performance over several months. Key data columns include:

Tools Microsoft Excel was used for all aspects of data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Excel’s functions, such as pivot tables, charts, and formulas, facilitated comprehensive analysis of campaign performance. Methods
  1.Data Cleaning: o Removed irrelevant columns and handled missing values. o Ensured consistency in data formats, especially for date columns. o Calculated a new column for profit to assess ROI.
  2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): o Descriptive Statistics: Calculated metrics such as mean, median, minimum, and maximum for key variables (e.g., revenue, cost, clicks). o Campaign Performance Summary: Used pivot tables to summarize and compare campaign revenue, cost, and clicks. o Correlation Analysis: Created scatter plots to explore the relationship between cost and revenue.
  3.Data Visualization: o Bar Charts: Visualized total revenue, cost, and profit for each campaign. o Line Graphs: Tracked campaign performance over time. o Dashboard: Developed an interactive dashboard displaying key metrics (revenue, cost, ROI) for a clear overview.
